Drawpile's versions consists of three or four parts:

1. The *server* version.
2. The *major* version.
3. The *minor* version.
4. If it's a development or beta release, it will have some kind of suffix identifying it as such.

For example, if you got version `1.2.3`, the server version is 1, major version is 2 and minor version is 3. A beta release may look something like `1.2.3-beta.4`.

A change in the minor version doesn't break any compatibility. It may add new features or fix bugs, but all files and sessions will be interoperable. The [protocol version](#protocol-version) won't change between these.

A change in the major version represents a client-side change. Usually this means that you can't join sessions hosted by different major versions, but the server doesn't need to be updated.

A change in the server version means that the network protocol is entirely incompatible. The client and server version must match for anything to work.

## Protocol Versions

Drawpile's network protocol also has versions. They work similar to the application version.

All clients in the *same session* must share the *exact* protocol version number (e.g. `dp:4.22.0`), unless they happen to provide additional compatibility modes.

A client can use any server that supports the same *server protocol version* (`4` in case of Drawpile 2.0.) However, some new features may not work with older servers.

The protocol version number consists of four parts:

1. namespace (`dp`)
2. server version (`4`, indicates change to client&harr;server protocol)
3. major version(`20`, indicates change to client&harr;client message structure)
4. minor version (`1`, indicates change to client&harr;client message semantics)

See the [protocol revision history](protocol#protocol-revision-history) for details

## Stability Promises

* Compatibility is never broken in patch releases (e.g. 2.0.0 &rarr; 2.0.1)
* Client compatability may only be broken between minor number bumps (e.g. 2.0.0 &rarr; 2.1.0)
* Server compatibility may only be broken between major number bumps (e.g. 2.0.0 &rarr; 3.0.0)
* Any new feature added without a protocol version bump must be backward/forward compatible

## Notes About Recording Compatiblity

* Version 1.0.6 can play recordings made with all previous versions (exact reproduction not guaranteed)
* Version 2.0.0 cannot play recordings made with older versions
* Opening recordings with a newer *minor* number will likely produce unexpected results
* Opening recordings with a newer *major* number will likely result in missing drawing actions
